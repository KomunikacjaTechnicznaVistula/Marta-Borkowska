        <p>Rate cards are available for all XTM users from the <i>Users</i> tab and are easily
            customizable.</p>

        <p>All you need is to enter a language combination and get the following information from
            your vendors:<ul id="ul_hqg_vyx_2tb">
                <li>language pairs</li>
                <li>base rate, e.g. â‚¬ 0.10</li>
                <li>percentage rates for different categories of matches, repetitions, MT matches,
                    etc.</li>
            </ul></p>
        <p>Here is a sample rate card for a translator:</p>
        <p><image href="../images/Rate%20card.jpg" scale="60" id="image_gw1_szx_2tb"/></p>
        <p>Based on this data, XTM generates a <xref href="quotations.dita">purchase order</xref>
            automatically for a translation project as a pdf file, which you can send to your vendor
            for approval. This automates the process and considerably shortens the translation
            turnaround time, because the quotation process can be very time consuming. In addition,
            you know exactly how much you will pay. Of course, it works well if you gather all this
            data well in advance, e.g. from the Cooperation Agreement signed with your vendor.</p>
